### About me:
📚 Reaching the end of my master studies in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology and Computer Engineering, at RWTH Aachen. There, I worked as a student assistant in the Institute of Hearing Technology and Acoustics (IHTA), formerly known as ITA, as a programmer for the Virtual Acoustics simulation software.

🎧 Currently based in Helsinki, developing my master thesis in the Aalto Acoustics Lab at Aalto Univeristy, in a collaboration with the group of Virtual Acoustics from Aalto and the PAAD research group from Aachen.
