Hola! I am Sergio de las Heras, MSc in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology and Computer Engineering by [RWTH Achen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de). In the last few years, I have been mostly focusing in acoustics and pyschoacoustics, working as as student assistant at [IHTA](https://www.akustik.rwth-aachen.de) and developing my master thesis in [Aalto Acoustics Lab](https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-acoustics-lab) in Helsinki. I am currently based in Copenhagen, working as a research intern at [Bang&Olufsen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com).

I studied my bachelors in Telecommunication Technologies Engineering at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es), before moving to Germany to pursue my masters degree. While in Madrid, I also studied clarinet, and became involved in university's photography society where I discovered my passion for analog photography. I am also fond of cycling and adventure on my free time.
