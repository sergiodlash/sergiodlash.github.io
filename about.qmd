📚 Reaching the end of my master studies in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology and Computer Engineering, at RWTH Aachen. There, I worked as a student assistant in the Institute of Hearing Technology and Acoustics (IHTA), formerly known as ITA, as a programmer for the Virtual Acoustics simulation software.

🎧 Developed my master thesis in the Aalto Acoustics Lab at Aalto Univeristy in Helsinki, in a collaboration with the group of Virtual Acoustics from Aalto University and the PAAD research group from RWTH AAchen.

🛠️ Currently based in Copenhagen, working on a research project for Bang&Olufsen.

⚡ I spend most of my free time beween cycling, photography and music, so I am always with my hands dirty!
